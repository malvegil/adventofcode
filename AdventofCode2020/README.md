## 2020 Advent of Code

This year's Advent of Code is being done a little later than usual. I switched jobs and tech stacks on 12/01/2020. 

I will be attempting to solve these puzzles in Javascript in Node or with Coffeescript.

For now: To run, go to the folder for that day and run `node dayXX`. The results will be printed on the console.

#### TODO
* Make a server so the user can go to http://localhost:5000/dayXX and see the results for that day.
* Have the main index a link to those days.
* Days incomplete will return the right error code.
* Going to /dayXX will return both results. Going to /dayXX/A or /dayXX/B will return just that star/part.
